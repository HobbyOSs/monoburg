Suggestions
===========

* Suggested by Akim Demaille:
  The macros emited to compensate glib might be grouped in a single string, 
  defined in an external file `/usr/share/monoburg/monoburg-header.h', then 
  output by a single call to output().

  This is nicer but it needs an external file to be installed.
