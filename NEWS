* New in 1.0.7:

General maintainance:
  - add support for gitlab-ci
  - support newer version of GCC
  - update autotools version

* New in 1.0.6, 2012-03-20:

Mostly a maintenance release.

** Remove hard-coded numeric values from the code.
** Do not require GNU Make.
** Rename directory `config' as `build-aux'.
** Simplify the Makefile machinery.


* New in 1.0.5, 2006-02-01:

** Rework MonoBURG options

Instead of `--with-line', provide a `--no-line' option, and output
`#line' directives by default.

The options

  `--without-glib',
  `--without-exported-symbols' and
  `--with-references'

become (respectively)

  `--no-glib',
  `--no-exported-symbols' and
  `--cxx-ref'.

** Support options as %-directives

  For instance, MonoBURG generates C++ references instead of pointers
  when using `--cxx-ref', or upon a `%cxx-ref' directive in the input
  file.  Idem for `%no-lines', `%no-glib' and `%no-exported-symbols'.

** Improve #line emission

Default include path is now "" instead of "." to avoid things like

  #line 1 "./tree.brg"


* 1.0.4

** Support named subtree with multi rules

  One can now do:
	num: Plus (Name1 : num, Name2 : num),
	num: Moins (Name3 : num, Name4 : num)
  Moreover, Name3 could be renamed Name1. The only restriction
  is that Name4 couldn't be named Name1 nor Name3.


* 1.0.3

** Add --with-line option

  Output of `#line' directives is now conditioned by this option.

** Clean memory use

  Memory leaks has been shooted.

** Remove limits on some features

  Depths of `%namespace' and `%include' are no more limited.


* 1.0.2a

** Reoganization of the sources

  Sources are split into several files, and are documented using
  Doxygen.  The GNU Build System is used.
